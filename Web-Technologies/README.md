# Web technology course

This project is a web application that consists of both front-end and back-end components. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end utilizes Node.js, Express, and SQLite3.

## Front-end

The front-end of the application is responsible for the user interface and client-side functionality. It is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Hypertext Markup Language provides the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets is used to style and visually enhance the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.

## Back-end

The back-end of the application handles the server-side logic and data storage. It is developed using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications and APIs.
- **SQLite3**: A lightweight and embedded relational database management system that provides a local database for the application.
